nanoHUB_remote
==============

nanoHUB_remote is a Python library for the `nanoHUB`_ science gateway platform.
It enables access to any installed nanoHUB tool as a web service, without 
requiring the user to know the details of the nanoHUB `web api`_ or the XML 
specifications of tool inputs and outputs.

The nanoHUB_remote.ipynb notebook demonstrates the use of this library.
